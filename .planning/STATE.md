## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Start fresh (v2) vs iterate on v1: v1 architecture was legacy from non-agentic approach, never worked properly
- Research before building: User wants to learn from prior art on self-improving agents

### Pending Todos
